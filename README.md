# React TicTacToe

I created this as a submission for the Friday hackathon with the School of Code. It converts the React tutorial class version to utilise updated hooks available in React 16.8.\

<br/><br/>

## Details

Initially, due to Friday hackathon time constraints, I did not fully complete this submission on time. I refactored code after in my spare time to fully integrate React hooks into the code and further implement the timetravel feature present in the react tutorial class version. I have also spent time clearing bugs with counter selections being incorrect. This version utilises an object oriented method to clearly define the components of the tictactoe game such as the board, squares etc. I utilised basic css to flex the rendering into a fixed width and height box to create the final ui.
